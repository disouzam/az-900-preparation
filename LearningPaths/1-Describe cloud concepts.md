# Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud concepts

[Link: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-describe-cloud-concepts/)


## Learning objectives 

(extracted from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-compute/2-introduction-cloud-compute)

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

1. **Define cloud computing**
2. **Describe the shared responsibility model**
3. **Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid**
4. **Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model**
5. **Describe the consumption-based model**
6. **Compare cloud pricing models**


## Define cloud computing

1. *Delivery of computing services over the internet* (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-compute/3-what-cloud-compute)
   1. Virtual machines
   2. Databases
   3. Storage
   4. Networking
2. *Free of constraints of a physical infrastructure (somewhat)*
3. *Additional services offered may include:*
   1. Internet of Things (IoT)
   2. Machine Learning (ML) and 
   3. Artificial Intelligence (AI)


## Shared responsibility model

   1. Physical security, Power, Cooling, Network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider
   2. Data and information stored in the cloud (what is the difference of data and information for Microsoft?) and access security are the responsibility of the customer of the cloud provider
   3. Responsibility shifts from mostly the cloud provider (Saas) to the customer (IaaS). PaaS solutions have mixed responsibilities between cloud provider and customer


## Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid

Three main cloud models are: private, public and hybrid. Then the question is: What are the other ones?
- Another one is multi-cloud: using several providers


## Describe the consumption-based model

- Difference between CapEx and OpEx
  - **CapEX** is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-compute/6-describe-consumption-based-model)
  - **OpEx** is spending money on services or products over time (same reference as above)

> *Instead, you pay for the IT resources you use. If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.*

This statement must be taken with care with regards to the meaning of **use**. If a VM is configured but not accessed, it means *use* for cloud provider because it have been deployed sometime.
